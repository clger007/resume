## Projects

### Data-Driven Surgical-site Infection Identification with XGBoost
[Publication](https://aricjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13756-023-01294-0)

Developed a pipeline to identify surgical-site infections from EMRs, using data labeled by the Provincial Infection Control Group. EMR data was extracted via **SQL**, cleaned with **Python**, and preprocessed using NLP techniques. Features were extracted with **Scikit-Learn**, and an **XGBoost** model addressed data imbalance with undersampling and **SMOTE**. The model showed promising results across key evaluation metrics.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
