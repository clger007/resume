## Projects
### Data-Driven Surgical-site Infection Identification with XGBoost

Developed a pipeline to identify surgical-site infections from EMRs, using data labeled by the Provincial Infection Control Group. EMR data was extracted via **SQL**, cleaned with **Python**, and preprocessed using NLP techniques. Features were extracted with **Scikit-Learn**, and an **XGBoost** model addressed data imbalance with undersampling and **SMOTE**. The model showed promising results across key evaluation metrics.

### Using LLMs for Interpretation and Reasoning of Pathology Reports
- Pioneered the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5/4 to interpret pathology reports, significantly enhancing the determination of complete pathological responses (pCR) and thus the accuracy of cancer treatment assessments.
- Developed a secure framework for processing de-identified reports and implemented an additional in-house pipeline for analyzing original pathology reports with a locally deployed LLM, addressing patient and physician privacy concerns.
- Employed the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to fine-tune transformer-based models, achieving a substantial increase in model performance with 91% Sensitivity and 95% Positive Predictive Value (PPV) on a chart review dataset.

### Estimating Cancer Diagnostic Interval Using Deep Learning Method
- Orchestrated the design and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze care patterns, achieving effective classification of four major cancer types and advancing early detection efforts.
- Tailored the CNN to identify nuanced patterns in patient visits, integrating visit type and timing to uncover early indicators of cancer, thereby contributing to potential improvements in diagnostic timeliness.

## Skills & Abilities
- **Machine Learning**: Expert in-depth knowledge of machine learning and deep learning principles, with practical experience in applying these techniques to healthcare data analysis and predictive modeling.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Expert in NLP, with a focus on extracting clinical insights from unstructured healthcare data, including EMR text analysis and medical literature review.
- **Programming & Software Development**: Expert in Python and its data-centric frameworks, with a robust foundation in object-oriented programming. Proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases, with hands-on experience in data warehousing solutions like Snowflake.
- **Communication**: Strong skills in delivering clear presentations, writing concise reports, and data visualization. Adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams and facilitating effective communication channels.
